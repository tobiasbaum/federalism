# federalism
Very sketchy study to check if federalism is beneficial.
I looked for a correlation between the Regional Authority Index from http://garymarks.web.unc.edu/data/regional-authority/ and data on the gross domestic product per capita (inhabitant) and the Human Development Index. The sample of countries is purely by convenience, i.e., countries that I could quickly gather the data for.

The Pearson Correlation between RAI and GPD per capita is 0.32, i.e., there is a positive association between federalism and the GDP per inhabitant. Similarly for HDI, which isn't very surprising as GDP per capita is a major influence of the HDI. Kendall's tau correlation is also positive and statistically significant.
